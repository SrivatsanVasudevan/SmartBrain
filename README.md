# SmartBrain - The Face Recognition Application!

---

SmartBrain is a full stack application that identifies whether an image has a face or not. You can register an account and sign in to the application to access it. Once you have signed 
in, all you have to do is provide the public URL of any image and the application will identify if it has a face or not!

The project was built using JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL, HTML and CSS.
