# SmartBrain - The Face Recognition Application!

---

SmartBrain is a full stack application that identifies whether an image has a face or not. You can register an account and sign in to the application to access it. Once you have signed 
in, all you have to do is provide the public URL of any image and the application will identify if it has a face or not!

The project was built using JavaScript, ReactJS, NodeJS, ExpressJS, PostgreSQL, HTML and CSS.

Here are the steps to run this application:
1. Clone the application.
2. Run npm/yarn to install the required packages/dependencies required for the project.
3. You will need to run the SmartBrain Server to have the project working, which is available [here](https://github.com/SrivatsanVasudevan/SmartBrain-Server).
4. Run npm start/ yarn start to get the project running!
